<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Superset Coach is a custom GPT that interacts with users to provide workout planning and logging features. It does not independently collect, store, or share personal data outside of the services explicitly authorized by the user.</p>

<p>The Google Sheets integration (Actions) uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and only accesses the spreadsheets the user grants access to. All workout logs remain within the user's Google account in the file <strong>Superset Tracker Logs</strong>. The developer of this GPT does not store user data.</p>

<p>Since Superset Coach is powered by GPT technology, responses may contain errors or inaccuracies. Users are responsible for verifying the information provided.</p>
